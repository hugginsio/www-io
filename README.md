My personal website, currently styled after [the venerable Linux manual page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page).

For the time being, it is merely some handwritten HTML enhanced with TailwindCSS. I am currently building a static site generator with Go, and I will switch to that tool once it is completed.
